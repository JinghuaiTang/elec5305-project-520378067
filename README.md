# üéµ Recognize and Extract Special Sound Signals using Neural Networks

The goal of this project is to use neural networks to recognize and extract special sound signals. In complex acoustic environments, target sounds are often masked by background noise, making it difficult for traditional signal processing techniques to achieve satisfactory performance. By introducing deep learning methods, we aim to automatically learn time-frequency features of sound signals, thereby achieving higher accuracy and robustness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The methodology of this project is divided into four stages:

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and organize datasets containing target sounds and background noise, and expand them if necessary through recording; apply preprocessing techniques such as noise reduction, normalization, and framing; apply data augmentation (e.g., adding noise, time stretching) to improve model generalization.  

2. **Model Design**: Employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the core architecture, converting sound signals into spectrograms or Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as inputs; in addition, incorporate traditional signal processing techniques (e.g., filtering, spectral subtraction) as baselines for comparison.  

3. **Training Process**: Train the model with cross-entropy loss and optimizers such as Adam or SGD; adopt mini-batch training and monitor validation performance, adjusting hyperparameters as necessary.  

4. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on an independent test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics, while also testing robustness under different noise conditions.
