The theme of this project is to use neural networks to recognize and extract special
sound signals. Our plan is to build and train an appropriate model so that the system
can automatically distinguish target sounds from background noise and extract
useful features. This will not only help us gain a deeper understanding of sound
signal processing and deep learning methods, but also lay the groundwork for future
applications such as speech recognition, medical sound detection, or environmental
monitoring. In this project, we will focus on implementing a basic model and
verifying its performance, combining with complex structures if the simple model
reaches a high qualify.
